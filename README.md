# Loc-July-CodeChef
Lord of the Code (LoC) is a series of competitive programming contests hosted every month, by Code@Amrita, the coding club at Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri campus. One of the aims of this monthly contest is to create awareness about the competitive programming and problem solving among the school students. While the focus is on the students in Kerala, anybody who is interested in coding can participate in the contest. The contest is conducted on CodeChef every month. Contest spans over three days â€“ Friday through Sunday. The contest will focus on problem solving rather than direct implementation of the programming language syntax and built in functions.
